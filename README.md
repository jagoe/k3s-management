# k3s-management

This repo contains tools and manuals that help (mostly me) to manage and work on a self-hosted `k3s` server.

Feel free to use what you think is useful, but be aware that there is no structure, roadmap, or goal to all this.

## Subjects

* [`add-user`](./add-user) — Add a user with their own namespace to the cluster
* [`k8s-intro`](./k8s-intro) — Short, hands-on introduction to k8s with little to none background info
